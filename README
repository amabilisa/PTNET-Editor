PTNET EDITOR
============

A place/transition net is a generalized and not colored Petri Net.

PTNET Editor is a Qt/C++ based application that allows you to graphically draw/edit a place/transition net, 
to animate it, to analyse it by constructing its coverability graph, to convert  it to an image file and to 
save it in the standard PNML format.


IMPORTANT: To test the application without passing by sections "2. PNML" and "3. RNG to XSD conversion",
go to the "tabwidget.cpp" source file and comment steps [0], [1] et [2] in the method "validateXml(...). In other word,
modify this method so that it always returns "true" saying that the PNML document is valide ... DO THAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!
as a non validated document might crash the application if it doesn't respect the PNML specification!!!

1. Requirements
---------------

This version was tested on GNU/Linux OpenSUSE 13.1 32-bit Operating System and requires
the following packages version to be compiled without troubles:

       + gcc-4.8.1
       + g++-4.8.1
       + libqt4-4.8.5-5.17.1.i586
       + boost-devel-1.53.0-4.1.2.i586
       + graphviz-devel-2.28.0-19.1.3.i586
       
       
2. PNML
-------

PNML (Petri Net Markup Language) is a standard Petri Net models interchange format based on XML.
The application use this  format. 

*Download the PNML grammar here: http://www.pnml.org/metamodels.zip

Our application is a place/transition net editor. Therefore, we need just the following files:

       + "pnmlcoremodel.rng": the core model definition.
       + "ptnet.rng": place/transition specific types definition: initialMarking and inscription (arc weight).
       + "anyElement.xsd": where we can define some types not provided by the standard PNML grammar and specific to our tool
       + "conventions.rng": included in "ptnet.rng"

3. RNG to XSD conversion
------------------------

The PNML grammar is written using the RELAX NG language, an alternative of XML Schema. Unfortunately, this 
language is not supported by the XML module of the Qt library. Hence, we have to convert the needed RNG files
to XSD.

We will use "Trang" to accomplish this conversion. You can download it here: http://code.google.com/p/jing-trang/downloads/list.

*to convert to XSD:

       1. create the folder "Trang/rng"
       2. create the folder "Trang/xsd"
       3. copy the 4 files in "Trang/rng"
       4. java -jar trang.jar -I rng -O xsd rng/ptnet.rng xsd/ptnet.xsd
       
*The application will use the 4 XSD files to validate a PNML document that depicts a Petri Net. So, we 
have to:

       5. copy the xsd files in "ptnet/schemas"
       6. modify the "anyElement.xsd" by replacing the "xs:group" tag by the content of "ptnet/schemas/anyElement.txt"
       
       
4. Testing the application
--------------------------

You can test the application by opening the models in "ptnet/examples":

        + To modify the properties of a place, transition or arc double-clic it.
        + During the animation of a Petri Net, make a single left-clic on a transition to fire it.
        
That's it .. Enjoy :)
